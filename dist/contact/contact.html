            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my portfolio! As you can see on the top-left, I've been a big PlayStation fan since I was pretty young. 
                The unique sound-effects, classic indie games, and overall aesthetic have always kept me engaged with Sony. 
                I would have never gotten closer to technology if it weren't for these game consoles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a great portion of my childhood trying to pirate game titles lol (for legal reasons, I was never successful). 
                However, it fascinated me how computers were able to do so much everywhere, especially with video games. 
                Gradually, I explored my interests and thought software engineering was a great career to pursue, especially since programming can feel like a game sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I enjoy computer science and software, I have found greater interest and passion for data; 
                its architecture, cleaning, distribution, and consistent real-time application are intriguing to me. 
                Data-informed decisions are the backbone of everything. 
                I hope to combine my game-like interest in programming and deep curiosity for data science into a strong and passionate career.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Thanks for visiting!</strong></p>
